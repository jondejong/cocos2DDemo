cocos2DDemo
===========

Slides and code from January, 2013 presentation at Minnesota CocoaHeads

The demo project includes Kobold2D. You should be able to simply open the workspace Kobold2D/Kobold2D-2.0.3/Kobold2D.xcworkspace. From here you should be able to launch the target in the iPhone simulator.

This demo project covers everything up through slide 18. The next bit of code came from a game in progress. The physics demo was from Hoopy Drop, avaliable in the App Store.

Hope this was useful!
